# Playing Card Recognition

This project was building using python,opencv and numpy

Abstract: This project was build in order to pass the image processing class at the University of Kavala Greece and learn
how we can process one image using nowdays technology. Basically the program will capture a frame crop it, gray scale it and find
the keypoints and descriptors using the sift algorithm to compare the training images with the captured one. After the comparison
done then we will draw and display using the plot function the result on our screen
